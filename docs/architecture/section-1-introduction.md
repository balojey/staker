# Section 1: Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Solana SPL Token Management Suite, including the frontend implementation and its integration with the existing on-chain smart contracts. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
The project foundation is a codebase generated by an AI UI tool (e.g., v0). The analysis confirms the following:
* **Framework:** React with Vite
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Component Library:** shadcn/ui
* **Blockchain Integration:** Pre-configured with stubs for the Solana Wallet Adapter.

This architecture will formalize and build upon this generated foundation, ensuring it is scalable, maintainable, and secure.
