# Section 15: Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

  * A strict **Content Security Policy (CSP)** will be configured.
  * The dApp is **non-custodial** and will never handle user private keys.
  * The on-chain program requires a **professional security audit** before mainnet deployment.

## Performance Optimization

  * **Vite** will be used for bundle optimization and code-splitting.
  * **Skeleton loaders** will be used to improve perceived performance.
  * **Zustand** will be used for client-side caching of on-chain data to reduce RPC calls.
