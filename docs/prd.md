## Section 1: Goals and Background Context

### Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-07-27 | 1.1 | De-scoped Token Swap feature (Epic 3) based on architectural findings. | Winston (Architect) |
| 2025-07-27 | 1.0 | Initial PRD draft | John (PM) |

### Goals
* Drive significant user adoption of the underlying smart contract suite.
* Establish the dApp as a trusted and easy-to-use tool within the Solana ecosystem.
* Enable users to successfully stake tokens and claim rewards in under 5 clicks.
* Achieve a high monthly retention rate.

### Background Context
This project will create a user-friendly frontend for an existing Solana SPL Stake Pool smart contract. The primary problem this solves is the high technical barrier for non-developers to interact with smart contracts, which limits their adoption. By providing an intuitive, secure, and unified web interface, this dApp will make SPL staking accessible to a broader audience, capitalizing on the growing interest in the Solana ecosystem.

## Section 2: Requirements

### Functional
1.  **FR1**: Users must be able to connect their existing Solana wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to the application.
2.  **FR2**: Upon wallet connection, the application must display the user's balances for relevant SPL tokens.
3.  **FR3**: The application must provide an interface for users to stake their SPL tokens into the appropriate smart contract.
4.  **FR4**: The interface must allow users to view their current staked positions, including the amount staked and accrued rewards.
5.  **FR5**: Users must have the ability to initiate an unstaking action and claim their earned rewards, subject to the smart contract's rules.

### Non-Functional
1.  **NFR1**: The application must be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
2.  **NFR2**: The application must operate in a non-custodial manner; it must never have access to or store user private keys. All transactions must be client-side and require the user's explicit signature via their connected wallet.
3.  **NFR3**: The UI must feel fast and responsive. Any delays due to on-chain transaction processing must be clearly communicated to the user via loading states, spinners, and transaction status notifications.
4.  [cite_start]**NFR4**: The frontend must be built using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. [cite: 2041, 2045-2046, 2049]

## Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be simple, intuitive, and secure. The primary goal is to abstract away the complexities of the blockchain, making the dApp feel more like a modern fintech application than a traditional, expert-focused DeFi tool. Every interaction should build user confidence and clarity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Connect-Wallet First:** The initial state of the app prompts the user to connect their wallet, which is the entry point to all functionalities.
* **Task-Oriented Layout:** The application will be clearly divided into sections for each core task.
* **Clear Transaction Confirmation:** All actions that initiate an on-chain transaction will use a modal to clearly display what the user is signing.
* **Real-time Feedback:** The UI will provide immediate feedback for user actions, using toasts and notifications to communicate the status of on-chain transactions.

### Core Screens and Views
Based on the MVP scope, the following core screens are required:
* **Dashboard / Home:** A primary view after connecting the wallet that shows a summary of the user's token balances and an overview of their current staked positions.
* **Staking Page:** A dedicated interface for staking tokens, viewing staking pools/options, unstaking, and claiming rewards.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

### Branding
*Assumption:* No formal branding guidelines have been provided. A modern, clean, dark-mode-first aesthetic is suggested.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be designed with a mobile-first approach to be fully responsive and functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile web browsers.

## Section 4: Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
A **Monorepo** structure is strongly recommended to manage the frontend and any shared utilities in a single repository.

### Service Architecture
This will be a **Decentralized / On-Chain Architecture**. The React frontend will act as a pure client-side application. All business logic is contained within the on-chain Solana smart contracts.

### Testing Requirements
A **Full Testing Pyramid** approach is recommended, including Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* [cite_start]The frontend will be built using **React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui**. [cite: 2041, 2045-2046, 2049]

## Section 5: Epic List
* **Epic 1: Project Foundation & Wallet Integration:** Establish the initial React application structure with the chosen tech stack and enable users to securely connect and disconnect their Solana wallets.
* **Epic 2: Core Staking Functionality:** Develop the complete user interface for staking SPL tokens, viewing staked positions, unstaking, and claiming rewards.

## Section 6: Epic 1: Project Foundation & Wallet Integration

**Epic Goal:** To establish a robust, production-ready foundation for the React application and deliver the first piece of core user value: the ability to connect and manage a Solana wallet connection.
