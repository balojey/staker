# Section 6: Epic 1: Project Foundation & Wallet Integration

**Epic Goal:** To establish a robust, production-ready foundation for the React application and deliver the first piece of core user value: the ability to connect and manage a Solana wallet connection.

**Story 1.1: Initial Project Setup**
* **As a** developer, **I want** a new React project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, **so that** I have a consistent and modern foundation to build upon.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A new React project is created using Vite.
    2.  TypeScript is configured with strict settings.
    3.  Tailwind CSS is fully configured and integrated.
    4.  `shadcn/ui` is initialized and a basic Button component can be rendered.
    5.  The project runs successfully on a local development server.

**Story 1.2: Integrate Solana Libraries & Wallet Adapter**
* **As a** developer, **I want** to install and configure the Solana wallet-adapter, **so that** the application can communicate with user wallets.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` packages are installed.
    2.  The `WalletProvider` context is correctly wrapped around the root of the application.
    3.  The application compiles and runs without errors after adding the providers.

---

**Story 1.3: Implement Wallet Connection UI**
* **As a** user, **I want** to see a "Connect Wallet" button, **so that** I can connect my wallet.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A "Connect Wallet" button is visible in the application's header.
    2.  Clicking the button opens the wallet adapter's selection modal.
    3.  Successfully connecting a wallet establishes a session.

---

**Story 1.4: Display and Manage Connection State**
* **As a** user, **I want** to see my wallet address when connected and have an option to disconnect, **so that** I can manage my session.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  When connected, the "Connect Wallet" button is replaced with the user's truncated wallet address.
    2.  Clicking the address reveals a "Disconnect" option.
    3.  Clicking "Disconnect" terminates the wallet session and reverts the UI.
