## Goals
* Drive significant user adoption of the underlying smart contract suite.
* Establish the dApp as a trusted and easy-to-use tool within the Solana ecosystem.
* Enable users to successfully stake tokens and claim rewards in under 5 clicks.
* Achieve a high monthly retention rate.

## Background Context
This project will create a user-friendly frontend for an existing Solana SPL Stake Pool smart contract. The primary problem this solves is the high technical barrier for non-developers to interact with smart contracts, which limits their adoption. By providing an intuitive, secure, and unified web interface, this dApp will make SPL staking accessible to a broader audience, capitalizing on the growing interest in the Solana ecosystem.
