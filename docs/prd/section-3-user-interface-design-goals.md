# Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be simple, intuitive, and secure. The primary goal is to abstract away the complexities of the blockchain, making the dApp feel more like a modern fintech application than a traditional, expert-focused DeFi tool. Every interaction should build user confidence and clarity.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Connect-Wallet First:** The initial state of the app prompts the user to connect their wallet, which is the entry point to all functionalities.
* **Task-Oriented Layout:** The application will be clearly divided into sections for each core task.
* **Clear Transaction Confirmation:** All actions that initiate an on-chain transaction will use a modal to clearly display what the user is signing.
* **Real-time Feedback:** The UI will provide immediate feedback for user actions, using toasts and notifications to communicate the status of on-chain transactions.

## Core Screens and Views
Based on the MVP scope, the following core screens are required:
* **Dashboard / Home:** A primary view after connecting the wallet that shows a summary of the user's token balances and an overview of their current staked positions.
* **Staking Page:** A dedicated interface for staking tokens, viewing staking pools/options, unstaking, and claiming rewards.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Branding
*Assumption:* No formal branding guidelines have been provided. A modern, clean, dark-mode-first aesthetic is suggested.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be designed with a mobile-first approach to be fully responsive and functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile web browsers.
