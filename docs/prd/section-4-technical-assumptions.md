# Section 4: Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
A **Monorepo** structure is strongly recommended to manage the frontend and any shared utilities in a single repository.

## Service Architecture
This will be a **Decentralized / On-Chain Architecture**. The React frontend will act as a pure client-side application. All business logic is contained within the on-chain Solana smart contracts.

## Testing Requirements
A **Full Testing Pyramid** approach is recommended, including Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* [cite_start]The frontend will be built using **React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui**. [cite: 2041, 2045-2046, 2049]
