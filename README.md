# üéØ Solana SPL Stake Pool & Token Management Suite

This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing and interacting with a Solana SPL Stake Pool. It includes a full-featured Anchor program that serves as an interface to the official SPL Stake Pool program, and a modern, user-friendly React frontend for seamless user interaction.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Liquid Staking:** Deposit SOL or stake accounts to receive pool tokens.
- **Validator Management:** Add/remove validators, rebalance stake, and set preferred validators.
- **Dynamic Fees:** Configure and manage pool fees.
- **Token Metadata:** Create and update on-chain token metadata for the pool token.
- **User-Friendly Frontend:** A responsive and intuitive React-based UI for all staking operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a modern, decentralized application (dApp) architecture:

- **Frontend:** A React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses the Solana Wallet Adapter for secure, non-custodial wallet interactions.
- **Backend:** The on-chain logic is handled by an Anchor program that interfaces with the SPL Stake Pool program on the Solana blockchain.
- **Deployment:** The frontend is designed for deployment on JAMstack hosting platforms like Vercel, while the on-chain program is deployed to the Solana network.

For a detailed overview of the architecture, please refer to the [Fullstack Architecture Document](./docs/architecture.md).
